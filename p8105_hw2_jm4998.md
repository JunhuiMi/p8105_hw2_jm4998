# Problem 1

*Read data from
Excel*

``` r
Mr_data = read_excel("../dataset/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
                     sheet = 1, range = "A2:N336") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

*Join 2017 and 2018 precipitation
data*

``` r
prec_2018 = read_excel("../dataset/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
                     sheet = 3, range = "A2:B14") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = rep(2018, 12), month = month.name) %>%
  drop_na(total) 

prec_2017 = read_excel("../dataset/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
                     sheet = 4, range = "A2:B14") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = rep(2017, 12), month = month.name) %>%
  drop_na(total)

prec_all = full_join(prec_2018, prec_2017)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("month", "total", "year")

## Conclusions

1)  Mr\_data shows Mr.Â Trash Wheel data, with 285 observations. There
    are 14 key variables: dumpster, month, year, date, weight\_tons,
    volume\_cubic\_yards, plastic\_bottles, polystyrene,
    cigarette\_butts, glass\_bottles, grocery\_bags, chip\_bags,
    sports\_balls, homes\_powered.

2)  prec\_all shows the combination of 2017 precipitation and 2018
    precipitation data, with 19. observations. There are 3 key
    variables: month, total, year.

3)  The the total precipitation in 2018 is 23.5.

4)  The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 is 8.
